In 2019, Hex-Rays released IDA Pro 7.2, which introduced many new features and improvements, such as enhanced support for PIC microcontrollers, NEC 850 processors, and ARM64 decompiler.
 
However, some users claimed that they found a leaked version of IDA Pro 7.2 on the internet, which they could download and use for free. They posted links to websites that allegedly hosted the cracked software, such as [^2^].
 
However, downloading and using such software is illegal and risky. It may violate the intellectual property rights of Hex-Rays, expose the user to malware infections, or damage the user's system. Moreover, it may not work properly or have all the features of the official version.
 
Therefore, it is strongly advised to avoid downloading or using any leaked or cracked version of IDA Pro 7.2. Instead, users should purchase a legitimate license from Hex-Rays or use the free version of IDA Pro 5.0 that is available on their website.

IDA Pro 7.2 is a state-of-the-art tool that can handle complex and obfuscated code with ease. It has a rich set of features that enable users to perform static and dynamic analysis, such as:
 
- Graphical user interface that allows users to navigate and manipulate code in various views, such as disassembly, pseudocode, hex dump, strings, etc.
- Powerful scripting engine that supports Python and IDC languages, which can be used to automate tasks, extend functionality, or create plugins.
- Advanced debugging capabilities that support remote debugging, breakpoints, watchpoints, tracepoints, memory dumps, etc.
- Decompilers that can generate high-level code from binary code for various architectures, such as x86, x64, ARM32, ARM64, MIPS32, MIPS64, etc.
- Support for various file formats and loaders, such as PE, ELF, Mach-O, COFF, etc.
- Support for various processor modules and instruction sets, such as Intel x86/x64, ARM/Thumb/NEON/AARCH64/Cortex-M/RISC-V/PIC/AVR/8051/MSP430/Z80/HC08/68k/etc.

IDA Pro 7.2 is a must-have tool for anyone who wants to analyze code at a deep level. It can help users to understand how programs work, find vulnerabilities, reverse engineer algorithms, or modify code behavior.
